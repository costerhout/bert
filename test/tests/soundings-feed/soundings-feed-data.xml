            <![CDATA[<p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>I hope this letter finds each of you well and enjoying summer.</p><p>Thanks for the kind words and support. I&#8217;ve received so many letters and packages and am really touched to be part of such a caring community. I am doing well and will be back at work this fall. I continue to go to physical therapy and doctors appmnts most days of the week, and am hiking and stretching everyday and walking without a cane. I am not in pain, and am able to drive around now, which makes the day-to-day more convenient. I have one remaining acute injury, a hole in my side that is slowly healing from the inside out. I cant rock climb yet, but am getting closer, and am now doing some longer alpine hikes. I will be in Anchorage another month to six weeks as an out patient, and will be moving into an apartment next week-- I&#8217;ll pass that address along when I get it.</p><p>Thank you for the donations. This still leaves me speechless, but helped to clear my mind about summer work, which at this point i am still unable to participate in. I am still processing how to respond, but thank you very much.</p><p>I am working on a brief write up of my incident and will pass that along when it is complete.</p><p>With love,</p><p>Forest</p>]]>

A second home next door will be completed by students during the Fall 2016 semester.<br /><br />
&#8220;This is increasingly better for the university and the students,&#8221; said Career Education Executive Dean Pete Traxler.&#160; People are looking at more skills to make their resume stronger and raise their ranking as far as employability.

        <content>
            <![CDATA[<p>The 2016 Juneau campus student commencement speaker represents the best of UAS. Jasper Nelson is on the fast track to return to his home town as a biology teacher. He graduated with his Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) with an endorsement in Biology. In 2015, Jasper earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology at UAS. Of Tsimshian heritage, Jasper was born in Ketchikan and grew up in Craig, on Prince of Wales Island. For his MAT student teaching experience, Jasper taught chemistry and biology to Thunder Mountain High School students. Alaska Native educator Angie Lunda, who nominated Jasper as student speaker, noted that &#8220;through his deep knowledge of Southeast Alaska and his content area, his use of humor in his lessons, and his genuine caring for all students, Jasper and his mentor teacher built an engaging and rigorous biology program for the students in their TMHS class of 2016.&#8221; Jasper earned a big laugh from the commencement audience when he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m no longer that chubby kid with the backpack full of zoo books. I&#8217;m that chubby teacher with a backpack full of science journals.&#8221; Said Chancellor Rick Caulfield, &#8220;Jasper Nelson epitomizes why UAS exists&#8212;to enable young Alaskans of diverse cultural backgrounds to fulfill their dreams and ambitions. His hope is to return to Craig next year as a certified teacher.&#8221;</p>]]>

Awards were granted to 670 graduates from the Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka campuses. &#8220;We are enormously proud of the accomplishments of these UAS graduates,&#8221; said Chancellor Rick Caulfield. &#8220;Many are first-generation college students&#8212;the first in their family to achieve this level of education. Others are older non-traditional students who are already employed and raising a family but are working hard to improve their education, their skills, and the well-being of their families.&#8221;</p>]]>

Brenda Hurley has been putting students first for the last 20+ years at the Ketchikan campus. She is probably one of the most familiar faces of the University. Students know they can ask Brenda just about anything and she will have the answer. Faculty will often go to Brenda for a wide variety of things, from room scheduling to filling out forms.</p><p>Each year after commencement, she will invariably have an idea to make the event even better the next time. She does all this, not because it is part of her job, but because she knows our students by name and how hard they have worked to make it to graduation. She makes each commencement special for the students and their families through her hard work, great ideas and attention to detail.</p><p>Brenda is hard working and always willing to take on new tasks when asked. She works quickly and efficiently to meet the needs of the students regarding course registrations and student records. Brenda treats students and staff with a high degree of professionalism and respect. Her accuracy and depth of institutional knowledge is of the utmost importance to student success.</p><p>Many times over the years Brenda's made a personal investment in making certain that students who are lost, frustrated, confused, and/or stressed have a sounding board for their issue. Partly because of Brenda&#8217;s long record of employment at UAS, but mostly because she is a patient, nurturing person, she is a master at sensitively guiding matters through various channels and producing results.</p><p>Staff behind the scenes can often be more influential to student success than we realize; Brenda Hurley is one of those individuals at UAS. While she doesn&#8217;t work directly with students every day, what she does every day is always student centered. Not afraid to ask the hard questions, Brenda is always directing the discussions to consider, &#8220;Will this benefit or hurt students?&#8221;</p><p>Brenda isn&#8217;t afraid to stand up for what she thinks is right and is consistently evaluating how things impact our students.<br /><br /></p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>Four faculty members were the recipients of annual Excellence Awards during a ceremony at the Auke Lake campus on May 2. Juneau faculty Karen Mitchell (English), Jason Amundson (Environmental Science), Johanna Fagen (Biology) and Ketchikan faculty William Urquhart (Sociology) were selected by their peers and students for excellence in teaching, research, adjunct instruction and faculty advising. Winners were chosen through letters of support from UAS faculty, staff, research colleagues, students or community members, and based on accomplishments, published materials highlighting achievements and evidence of exceptional service to UAS or community. Johanna Fagen was nominated for her teaching ability, of which a student said, &#8220;During class discussions I have always had the sense that Johanna is more interested in helping us all form our own informed opinions rather than steering us down one path.&#8221;&#160;&#160; In recognition of her retirement, her colleagues said that her stories, enthusiasm, kindness and boisterous laugh will be greatly missed. Professor Mitchell has been an adjunct instructor in English at the Juneau campus for more than 20 years. Mitchell is an active participant in Safe Zone training and is an ally for the LGBT community. Dr. Jason Amundson is known for his research record since arriving at UAS in the fall of 2011. In the last academic year he has secured more than $825,000 in external funding for his research. Dr. Urquhart&#8217;s many service opportunities include hiring committees, representing the Social Sciences department on the Curriculum Committee, mentoring new faculty, Title III principal Investigator, and spearheading the implementation of a new BA in Social Science degree available for distance delivery.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>Saturday, May 21, 2016, the University of Alaska Southeast Auke Lake campus is the site of the Alaskan premiere of <em>Inusksuit,</em> a multi-percussion musical experience by Pulitzer Prize winner and former Alaskan John Luther Adams. Raw, wild and epic, this outdoor event will include local musicians led by Juneau Jazz and Classics Artists-in-Residence Third Coast Percussion. A pre-event information session, including a video and message from&#160; Adams, is set for 1:30 p.m. in the Egan Lecture Hall. The interactive campus-wide performance will commence at 2 p.m. in the Mourant Courtyard by the whale sculpture.</p><p>Described by the <em>New York Times</em> as &#8220;the ultimate environmental piece,&#8221; Inuksuit involves a variety of percussion instruments and players dispersed through the outdoors on and around the UAS campus. The piece has been performed all over the world in recent years. &#8220;Each performance of Inuksuit is different,&#8221; Adams has said of the piece, &#8220;determined by the size of the ensemble, the specific instruments used, the topology and vegetation of the site, and even by the songs of local birds.&#8221;</p><p>The event is part of the final day of the annual Juneau Jazz &amp; Classics festival. Organizer Sean Connors of Third Coast Percussion said, &#8220;<em>Inuksuit</em> is a truly unique performance experience. It is at once an intricately structured concert work, a beautifully hypnotic sound installation, an interactive work of performance art, and a communal music making event like no other. It is not everyday that you can gather a large group of people together that are all excited about making a truly groundbreaking piece of art. It is sure to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for both the audience, the performers, the University of Alaska Southeast, and the greater Juneau community!&#8221;</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>Bystander Intervention Curriculum Coming to UAS</p><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put ending violence on our to-do list.&#8221; Lori Klein, UAS Title IX Coordinator is working with staff in Ketchikan, Sitka and Juneau to bring bystander intervention curriculum to UAS. &#8220;Many of us feel passionately about ending violence. Even if you don&#8217;t feel passionately about it, most people would agree it&#8217;s an important thing. But it feels like a huge task. Especially in Alaska, where our rates of violence, particularly violence against women, are huge.&#8221;</p><p>No one is expected to do big things, but if everyone is committed to doing small things, collectively we can work together to end violence. This is the foundation of Green Dot, an evidence-based bystander intervention curriculum rolling out this fall at UAS. The curriculum focuses on dating violence, domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault, but has practical implications for any situation where someone might be harmed. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to talk about changing our campus norms, we&#8217;re going to learn about various kinds of intervention and we&#8217;re going to practice small actions that can change our campus culture for the better,&#8221; Klein said.</p><p><em>Calling all Staff</em> &#8211; the first bystander intervention session will be offered during Staff Development Day. Juneau staff &#8211; please join your trainers Lori Klein and Sarah Belmont from 1:30-2:30 pm on Friday, May 13 in the Glacier View Room.</p><p>Faculty and student trainings will be offered in August and September.</p><p>For more information about Green Dot, please contact Lori Klein at 796-6036.</p>]]>

        <description>The UAS Juneau campus celebrates the 45th annual commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 1, 2 p.m. at the Charles Gamble Jr.-Donald Sperl Joint Use Facility, 12300 Mendenhall Loop Road (REC Center). The UAS Native &amp; Rural Student Center
            hosts its annual Alaska Native Graduation Celebration at 11:30 a.m. in the Egan Lecture Hall on the Auke Lake campus. In addition, a celebration of UAS School of Education graduates living elsewhere in Alaska will be held in Anchorage on Saturday,
            May 7.</description>
        <content>
            <![CDATA[<p>For Commencement 2016, the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS) is awarding 755 associate, bachelor, and master&#8217;s degrees along with occupational endorsements, certificates, and professional licensures. Awards will be granted to 670 graduates from the Juneau, Ketchikan, and Sitka campuses. This year&#8217;s number of awards is among the highest granted at commencement.&#160; UAS Chancellor Rick Caulfield and members of the UA Board of Regents will travel to each campus where the accomplishments of each student will be recognized.</p><p>The UAS Sitka Campus commencement ceremony takes place Friday, April 29, 2016 at 7:00 P.M. at the Sitka Fine Arts Camp. The UAS Ketchikan Campus ceremony is set for Saturday, April 30, 2016 at 3:00 P.M. at the Ted Ferry Civic Center.</p><p>The UAS Juneau campus celebrates the 45<sup>th</sup> annual commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 1, 2 p.m. at the Charles Gamble Jr.-Donald Sperl Joint Use Facility, 12300&#160;Mendenhall Loop Road (REC Center).&#160; The UAS Native &amp; Rural Student Center hosts its annual Alaska Native Graduation Celebration at 11:30 a.m. in the Egan Lecture Hall on the Auke Lake campus. In addition, a celebration of UAS School of Education graduates living elsewhere in Alaska will be held in Anchorage on Saturday, May 7.</p><p>Chancellor Rick Caulfield commented: &#8220;We are enormously proud of the accomplishments of these UAS graduates. Many are first-generation college students&#8212;the first in their family to achieve this level of education. Others are older non-traditional students who are already employed and raising a family but are working hard to improve their education, their skills, and the well-being of their families. Each and every one of these students has persevered through major challenges to achieve their educational goals. Congratulations to them all!&#8221;</p><p>This year&#8217;s Juneau student commencement speaker is Jasper Nelson. Jasper was born in Ketchikan and grew up in Craig on Prince of Wales Island. He is of Tsimshian heritage. He is graduating with his Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) with an endorsement in Biology and plans to teach in his home community. In 2015, Jasper earned a Bachelor of Science in Biology with the goal of becoming a high school biology teacher.&#160; For his MAT student teaching experience, Jasper is teaching chemistry and biology to Thunder Mountain High School students. Alaska Native educator Angie Lunda, who nominated Jasper for this recognition, notes that &#8220;through his deep knowledge of Southeast Alaska and his content area, his use of humor in his lessons, and his genuine caring for all students, Jasper and his mentor teacher have built an engaging and rigorous biology program for the students in their TMHS class of 2016.&#8221;</p><p>Jasper is sure to bring his sense of humor to his remarks Sunday. &#8220;I was surprised to be nominated. I thought I tricked someone into thinking I was eloquent,&#8221; joked Nelson. &#8220;But the honor was too much for me to pass up.&#8221;</p><p>Honorary Doctorate of Laws recipient Edward Thomas will deliver the Commencement Address. Thomas served with distinction as President of the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska from 1984-2014. He was an active leader in the Alaska Federation of Natives and secretary to the National Congress of American Indians. He played a foundational role in establishing legally binding government-to-government compacts between Alaska Native tribes and the federal government.</p><p>Sandro Lane will also receive an Honorary Doctorate of Law. Lane is co-owner of Trident Seafoods Corporation. A Juneau entrepreneur since 1984, Lane went from processing and selling cold-smoked salmon out of his garage to founding Taku Fisheries and Smokeries. He&#8217;s found ways to prevent fish carcass waste with the invention of proprietary processes to extract fish oil and protein. His salmon oil nutritional supplements are sold worldwide. He represents the best of Alaska&#8217;s business leaders and entrepreneurs.</p><p>A University of Alaska Meritorious Service award will be presented to Juneau community volunteer Peter Freer, who served on the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly and on the board for everything from Perseverance Theatre to the Glacier Swim Club. Meritorious service awards, approved by the UA Board of Regents, are also going to arts advocate Jeff Budd in Sitka and fishing industry innovator Larry Painter in Ketchikan.</p><p>The gender breakdown of the graduating class of 2016 is 60% women and 40% men. Nearly 9% of UAS graduates are Alaska Native/American Indian.</p><p>The Juneau commencement ceremony is immediately followed by a catered reception in the Lakeside Grill in the Mourant building on the UAS Auke Lake campus. Shuttle service will be available from the main campus parking area to the REC center.&#160; The event is simulcast on UATV Cable Channel 11 and other locations in Alaska. See this link for complete list: <a href="http://uatv.alaska.edu/cable.html">http://uatv.alaska.edu/cable.html</a>.

            <![CDATA[<p>Commencement ceremonies are set for April 29-May 1, 2016 on the Sitka, Ketchikan and Juneau campuses respectively.&#160; Seven hundred sixty-six graduates from the three campuses will earn associates, bachelors and masters degrees as well as occupational endorsements, certificates, and licensures.&#160; Edward Thomas and Sandro Lane will receive Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. Thomas is past president of the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska (1984-2014), member of the Alaska Federation of Natives and secretary to the National Congress of American Indians. He played a foundational role in establishing legally binding compacts between Alaska Native tribes and the federal government. Sandro Lane is currently co-owner of Trident Seafoods Corporation. An entrepreneur since 1984, Lane went from processing and selling cold-smoked salmon out of his garage to found Taku Fisheries and Smokeries, which still thrives on the Juneau waterfront. He&#8217;s found ways to prevent fish carcass waste and help protect our waters with the invention of proprietary processes to extract fish oil and protein. His salmon oil nutritional supplements are sold worldwide. Meritorious Service awards are going to Juneau community volunteer Peter Freer, Sitka arts advocate Jeff Budd and Ketchikan fishing industry innovator Larry Painter.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>More than two dozen admitted first-time freshmen from Alaska and the lower 48 were invited to the Juneau campus for the first ever Explore Southeast event, April 1-2. Campus Life partnered with Admissions and Recruitment for the program aimed at traditional college age students, including UA Scholars and Alaska Performance Scholarship recipients. The weekend employed best practices for orientation and recruitment with the goal of giving prospective students the ultimate Juneau campus experience. New students had the opportunity to experience UAS and begin building friendships with current students before starting school in the fall. Attendees joined a campus tour, attended faculty lectures, and toured the Anderson Building biology labs. They also visited the UAS Tech Center and the new Sealaska Heritage building downtown. Prospective incoming students stayed at the John Pugh Residence Hall, attended Campus Life activities such as a Quidditch match and hiked to Nugget Falls near the Mendenhall Glacier. Travel was provided by airline miles accrued by staff and faculty travel.</p>]]>

        <content>
            <![CDATA[<p>Dear UAS faculty and staff:</p><p>While all of Alaska, including our university, struggles with the state&#8217;s budget challenges, it&#8217;s important to remember why UAS exists: to support student learning and educational equity. In past few days I&#8217;ve had some exceptionally enjoyable encounters with UAS students and prospective new students; encounters that remind me how our work truly makes a difference in students&#8217; lives and improves the quality of life in our culturally-rich communities. In thinking about our mission, I want to share with you with a brief update about three of the six UAS strategic priorities we&#8217;ve set for ourselves in 2016 and 2017. You can find the full list of these priorities at: <a href="http://www.uas.alaska.edu/vicechancellor/docs/spbac/2015-11-11/uas_strategic_priorities.pdf">http://www.uas.alaska.edu/vicechancellor/docs/spbac/2015-11-11/uas_strategic_priorities.pdf</a></p><p>UPDATE 1: Increase enrollment and retention through strategic marketing and enrollment management.</p><p>We are redoubling our efforts to encourage prospective new students to choose UAS. This weekend in Juneau our recruiters and campus life staff are hosting an &#8220;Explore Southeast&#8221; event for selected high school students who&#8217;ve already applied for admission. The goal of this event is to have students engage with talented faculty and supportive staff and to experience the excitement of campus life. We want to &#8216;lock in&#8217; on these applicants and show them why UAS is a great choice. We&#8217;re also involving our current Alaska Leadership students (AL-I) to serve as student ambassadors. It&#8217;s clear that prospective students like to hear from their peers about what UAS has to offer. In addition, Ketchikan faculty and staff are expanding adult degree completion opportunities&#8212;reaching out to Alaskans who have some college but have never finished. We&#8217;ve also adjusted how we do our recruiting&#8212;including having Juneau-based recruiter Margo Connolly-Masson work much more closely with our Natural Sciences faculty in the School of Arts and Sciences to encourage talented high school science students to apply. As an example, she and Professor Sherry Tamone recently met with students at the Alaska Tsunami Ocean Sciences Bowl, held in Seward. We&#8217;re also working with the firm Strategies 360 to sharpen our recruitment message and to expand digital marketing. These are just some of the examples of how we&#8217;re working hard to grow our enrollments.</p><p>UPDATE 2: Review and improve UAS information technology programs and services</p><p>Working with Faculty Senate President Maren Haavig and Interim Provost Priscilla Schulte, I&#8217;ve contracted with Mr. Bruce Maas, Chief Information Officer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, to conduct an assessment of UAS IT programs and services. This assessment will consist of a voluntary confidential online survey for faculty, staff, and students. You&#8217;ll see that survey opportunity coming your way soon. Maas will visit UAS during the week of April 11 to conduct interviews and hear from faculty, staff, and students at all three UAS campuses. We expect to have his report from Mr. Maas in early May, including recommendations that will inform development of our FY17 budget. You can learn more about Maas at <a href="http://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-names-chief-information-officer/">http://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-names-chief-information-officer/</a></p><p>UPDATE 3: Strengthen university Title IX compliance, safety practices, and emergency readiness</p><p>This week we have an important opportunity to meet with Board of Regents members John Davies and student Regent Stacy Lucason who will be visiting the Juneau Campus on Thursday, March 31, to learn about how we&#8217;re addressing Title IX issues and concerns. Their goal is to support efforts to provide a safe learning environment free of sexual harassment and discrimination and to educate all members of the UAS community about these topics. For details see <a href="http://www.uas.alaska.edu/soundings/articles/2016/3/titleix-listening-tour.html">http://www.uas.alaska.edu/soundings/articles/2016/3/titleix-listening-tour.html</a> These are just a few of the actions we&#8217;re taking to address our strategic priorities.</p><p>As always, I value your ideas and comments.Send those to me at <a href="mailto:racaulfield@uas.alaska.edu">racaulfield@uas.alaska.edu,</a> and keep up the good work in support of our students and communities.</p><p>Thank you!</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>The 2016 Woosh K Poetry Slam at UAS was a rousing success. The monthly event was held Friday, March 25 at the Egan Lecture Hall as part of the Sound and Motion spring arts and culture series. The competition was well attended by a diverse group of community members and included a full slate of spoken word poets. Vibrant commentary and fluidity was provided by veteran emcee Conor Lendrum, who was joined by student and actor Austin Tagaban.</p><p>Professional spoken word and improv poet Jesse Parent spell bound 15 minute performance between sets. Parent was in town for a show at the Hangar Ballroom the following evening sponsored by a grant through local improvisational comedy enthusiasts.</p><p>Competitors arrived armed with three original poems. Long time Woosh K slam star, UAS student and Iraq war veteran Nathan Block was the runner up. His trio of poetry included the powerful Moons of Neptune.</p><p>The winner was Juneau native Ryan Carrillo, who performed spoken word versions of his recorded hiphop rap songs: The Colors in Truth, The Pretender and Lecture. &#8220;I want to transcend hip hop for listeners,&#8221; he said.&#160; Carrillo was very appreciative of the Sound and Motion audience.&#160; &#8220;They were able to process the lyrical layers of my songs. That&#8217;s what I enjoyed most about the poetry slam.&#8221; Carrillo has uploaded some of his music to YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/LWWPeiaGGhg">The Pretender</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/IEfQreERb_o">The Colors In Truth</a></p>]]>

The vast majority of its students are Alaska Native. At any given time, it serves students from 100-plus communities, many of them small villages. In Mt. Edgecumbe High School&#8217;s classrooms and dormitories, the state&#8217;s future leaders and achievers in many fields forge relationships for a lifetime. Dr. Laster, the Chair of the Educational Leadership Program at UAS and the designer of the only Superintendent Endorsement Program in Alaska, commented, &#8220;It is highly appropriate that a genuine Alaska leader will be guiding Alaska&#8217;s next generation of leaders.&#8221;</p><p>Credit to Emily Kwong KCAW</p>]]>
